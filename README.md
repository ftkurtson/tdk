BaseKit template SDK
====================

BaseKit template SDK provides an emulator to render a template's Twig and LESS files. There is support for rendering all types of widget.

Currently no support for widget Javascript.
Need to find a way to build this from the main BaseKit code base so that all widget files are always up-to-date.
