BaseKit Template SDK
====================

The BaseKit Template SDK provides an emulator to render a template's Twig and LESS files. There is support for rendering all types of widget.

The build file included can be used to pull in all the required files from the main BaseKit code base. For example, widget Twig and JS files are all included in this repository and therefore need to be regularly updated.
